# Homework 1: Critical Sections, Locks, Barriers and Condition variables

## Objectives
In this homework you learn how

- to solve the critical section problem, i.e. to access shared variables with mutual exclusion;
- to program condition synchronization (waiting for conditions) using condition variables;
- to build a concurrent (parallel) program of multiple threads with shared variables, namely 
    - to create and join concurrent threads and pass input parameters and results;
    - to synchronize threads with locks, barriers and condition variables,
    - to compile and run a concurrent program using Pthreads (or Java threads and concurrent utilities)
